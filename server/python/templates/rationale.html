The Autonomous Transport for Health: Encrypted Network: ATHEN. This acronym is contrived to be ``NEHTA'' spelt backwards, NEHTA was the 
``National E-health Transition Authority'', now known as the ``<a href="http://www.digitalhealth.gov.au">
Australian Digital Health Authority</a>'' 
</p>
<p>ATHEN is an alternative option for the MyEHR that respects privacy, decentralised and is easy-to-use.
</p>

<h3>The Components</h3>

<p>
  <ol>
    <li />An LDAP server providing information about doctors, hospitals and other health providers and their contact details, including email addresses, public encryption keys and mailing address. This is the only centralised part of the 
system however the LDAP server can be mirrored for redundancy and local use.
    <li />A mailserver (one public one, but unlimited private ones) configured to only use SMTP over TLS. When emails hit the system they are encrypted to the recipients key, if not already. Previously read emails are stored on an encrypted filesystem, which is mounted using the users' password as key, only when the user logs in to check their mail.
    <li />A web interface for reading and writing emails but with medical extensions (such as patient name, address, etc), emails are then translated to the PIT format and can be downloaded and imported into existing medical records automatically.
    <li />A simple downloader program for GPs (like `Fetch'  and similar programs used by the pathologists to send reports)
  </ol>
</p>

<h3>Internals</h3>
<p>
  The LDAP directory is a standard OpenLDAP which as public read-only access. It can be used by email clients such as Outlook, Thunderbird, etc to find recipients. The mailserver is Postfix, with configuration to insist on SMTP-TLS for sending and receiving mails. This means some ISPs won't work, but most will, and Gmail, Hotmail, etc, will all work, Dovecot IMAP is used to access mails, a Python script is attached to the Linux PAM system, when a user tries to log on, the script mounts the users home directory using their password to decrypt it, and then decrypts any new mails received in the meantime. A cron job runs every 10 minutes to see who is no longer logged on, and unmounts their home directory. The web interface is based on Roundcube with a specific medical plugin applied.</p>
<p> The server does not allow direct root logins. To get root access the administrator can only do this at certain times, late at night and when this happens all users are logged out and their directories unmounted first.
This is like the `time lock' on a bank vault, and for the same purpose: to defeat the adminstrator if they are under duress from an attacker.
</p>

</p>

<h3>Why Bother</h3>

<p>Email is generally not considered `secure enough' for medical use, although it is becoming increasingly common. There are two main problems with standard e-mail:
<ol>
<li />Emails can be read in transit by the ISP or by local network administrators (in hospitals). This is addressed by only using TLS/SSL connections.
<li />Stored emails can be read by the mailserver administrator, who, even if trusted, can be forced to hand over e-mails by a Court order (subpnoea). It is important to note that, in practice,
this is the main `attack surface' Australian clinicians have to deal with. This is addressed by local encrypted of stored emails after receipt, so even the mailserver admin cannot read the stored e-mails.
</ol>

<p> For many years various alternatives for secure messaging have been available such as Argus, HealthLink and so on. None has quite establishing enough dominance to replace e-mail,
mainly because they won't communicate with each other, and are not `backwards-compatible' with e-mail.</p>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

Of course whoever has physical access to a mailserver can ultimately override all security. However if they power down the machine, or unplug the hard drive, then all the user directories are unmounted and so encrypted, so this is not as easy as it sounds. Emails are unencrypted in server RAM, but only ever hit the hard drive on an encrypted state (X509-encrypted for new mails, filesystem-encrypted for the old ones). This means the administrator cannot be forced via a court order to provide emails, as they cannot be read without the user's own password. <p><p>The only true weakness is if the mailserver is secretly modified, the new administrator can then `lie in wait' for a user to log in, and grab the password and read all mails. To my knowledge, Australian Courts do not have the power to order an existing administrator to do this. All code is released open-source, so you are free to run your own mailserver.
