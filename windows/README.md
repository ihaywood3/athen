Windows 7 and later
------------------

Powershell is pre-installed on Windows 7 and later. The downloader is developed
on a stock Windows 7 system.


Windows Vista
-------------

You need at least Vista Service Pack 1

(remember this is the minimum system Microsoft support at present)

You then need to install PowerShell 2.0 installed

Windows XP
----------

I don't recommend running XP as it is not possible to keep it secure
in any real way.

You will need to install the Microsoft .NET 2.0 runtime and then Powershell 2.0
for XP. These files aren't hosted by Microsoft anymore (Internet Explorer in XP
can't even view the microsft.com website), but they may be available elsewhere.
